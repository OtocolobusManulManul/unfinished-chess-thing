# unfinished-chess-thing
incomplete lightweight c++ chess application

I will almost certainly come back to this later...

as it stands rn I'm just using this repo to save my attempt at making a chess bot for windows in C++ using nothing but windows headers, the stdlib and STL as dependancies. If you want to just play the game of chess, the logic is pretty much all there, as well are the primitives for implementing pretty much any game logic that relies on a similar tiled board system to chess.
